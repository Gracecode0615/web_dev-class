<p>Stepping into a tech event always feels like opening a new chapter one filled with learning, possibilities, and new perspective. While I’ve attended tech events before, this one felt different. The Lagos Startup Expo 2.0, hosted by Techpoint Africa, wasn’t just another gathering, it was a meaningful experience that reminded me why I do what I do.</p>


<p>As someone who works at the intersection of tech, education, and community development, especially through my work with Eclariage Africa, a nonprofit organization supporting underprivileged populations being in a space that celebrates innovation was deeply refreshing.</p>

<b>I stepped out for growth and I’m so glad I did!</b>


<p>Attending the <b>Lagos Startup Expo 2.0,</b> Africa’s biggest tech gathering hosted by Techpoint Africa, was more than just an event it was an experience.

From connecting with brilliant minds to discovering forward-thinking innovations, every moment reminded me why showing up matters. It’s not just about networking; it’s about learning, sharing, and being part of the movement that's shaping the future of tech in Africa.</p>
