<p>Stepping into a tech event always feels like opening a new chapter one filled with learning, possibilities, and new perspective. <br> While I’ve attended tech events before, this one felt different. The Lagos Startup Expo 2.0, hosted by Techpoint Africa, <br> wasn’t just another gathering, it was a meaningful experience that reminded me why I do what I do.</p>

<p>As someone who works at the intersection of tech, education, and community development, especially through my work with <b>Eclariage Africa</b>, <br> a nonprofit organization supporting underprivileged populations being in a space that celebrates innovation was deeply refreshing.</p>

<b>I stepped out for growth and I’m so glad I did!</b>
